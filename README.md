# GestureSenseIoT
**IMNY-UT 260-1 Introduction to Wearables, Fall 2023 | Professor Daniel Johnston**

The GestureSenseGlove repository houses the code, documentation, and other files for a gesture-sensing glove project, crafted as part of Introduction to Wearables class at NYU. Utilizing primarily the Arduino Nano 33 IoT, this glove translates natural hand movements into digital data that can be transmitted to IoT platforms.
